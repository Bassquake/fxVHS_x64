This is my attempt to convert the current 32 bit fxVHS plugin originally from https://www.rationalqm.us/flaxen/flaxen.html to 64bit.

Unfortunately I dont know enough about assembly so made this repository in case anyone wants to have a crack at it!

Project builds if you exclude the asm files and comment out the "Asm1();" etc functions. Obviously filter wont do anything without them but panel does load in VirtualDub 64 bit version!
